# This file specifies the dependencies that are needed to run tests for this project. Specifically,
# this file is fed into `tests_require` in `setup.py`. This file should contain ranges of
# requirements, not pinned versions. This file does not include pip-tools itself; that's included
# directly from `tox.ini`. When you update this file, run `tox -e pip-compile` to automatically
# update `requirements.txt`.
